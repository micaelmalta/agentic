# PARA Methodology: Philosophy and Principles

## Philosophy

PARA-Programming is built on these principles:

- **Planning reduces rework** - Think before you code
- **Documentation compounds** - Future you will thank present you
- **Context is currency** - Preserve it, don't lose it
- **Async-first** - Enable handoffs and resumption
- **Human-AI collaboration** - Structure helps both humans and AI work better

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Start small** - Use PARA for one task to learn the workflow
2. **Use `/check`** - When unsure if you need PARA, ask
3. **Keep plans focused** - One task per plan
4. **Write summaries promptly** - Don't wait, context fades fast
5. **Archive regularly** - Keep active context manageable
6. **Reference archives** - They're your project knowledge base
7. **Adapt the workflow** - PARA is a framework, not a prison

## Getting Help

- Run `/help` in any project for comprehensive guide
- Run `/check <task>` to decide if you need PARA
- Run `/status` to see where you are in the workflow
- See `CLAUDE.md` in your project for project-specific context

**Remember:** PARA is a tool to help you work better with AI, not a bureaucratic requirement. Use it when it adds value, skip it when it doesn't.
